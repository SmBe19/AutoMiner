# AutoMiner
Automatically find mines

## Requirements
You need `xdotool` and `gnome-screenshot` installed on your system.

## How to use
Start gnome mines and choose a field size. Set the color scheme to the one with the colored numbers. You can now start autominer (you may need to specify the window title) and it will automatically try to solve the game.
